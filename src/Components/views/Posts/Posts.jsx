              University of Zimbabwe (UZ) part-time lecturers are getting a
              measly US$2.50 stipend for every hour spent teaching at the
              country’s premier tertiary institution. In a widely-circulated
              internal memorandum from the deputy registrar responsible for
              Human Capital Management, only identified as T. S Makamure, dated
              March 13, 2024, the remuneration of adjunct lecturers was now
              blended, comprising of both United States (US) dollars and
              ‘worthless’ local currency. poster “Please be advised that the
              Vice Chancellor approved a blended remuneration of adjunct
              lecturers with effect from 9 March 2024. Adjust lecturers
              (formerly part-time lecturers) will now be paid their salary in
              both local currency and US dollars on a 50/50 basis. “The US
              dollar component will be calculated at two dollars and fifty cents
              ($2.50) per hour while the Zimbabwean dollar component remains the
              same.”

              HARARE – There were fears for Vice President Kembo Mohadi’s health
              on Thursday after he appeared to collapse while delivering a
              lecture at the University of Zimbabwe. Mohadi, 74, was in the
              middle of his address when he suddenly appeared to become
              disoriented and asked for water. His knees buckled shortly after
              and his aides rushed to help him back to his feet, a witness said.
              “He couldn’t stand and so they helped him to a chair. He spoke
              briefly after and after animated back stage discussions his
              presentation was cut short,” the witness said. Journalists at the
              event were ordered to stop filming and taking pictures by Mohadi’s
              aides from the Central’s Intelligence Organisation. The vice
              president was delivering a lecture on the title ‘Liberation
              Movements and African Unity: Why Resilience Matters for Sustained
              Transformative Possibilities.’ He was conspicuously absent later
              when President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the second Vice President
              Constantino Chiwenga attended the launch of 17 schools in Chikomba
              constructed with assistance from the OPEC Fund for International
              Development. George Charamba, the spokesperson in the presidency,
              said he was away throughout the day and asked for more time to
              gather the facts. He had not responded to our enquiries at the
              time of writing. A Zanu PF official briefed on the event told
              ZimLive: “He was reading his speech and then he asked for water.
              He had to be helped to sit down. He then continued his speech
              while seated. “He did not necessarily collapse. In essence he
              broke the collapse.” The same person also blamed organisers of the
              event, attended by higher education minister Prof Amon Murwira,
              “for the long speech.” Mohadi was treated for injuries from a
              grenade explosion at a Zanu PF rally at White City Stadium in
              2018, and a year later he was flown to South Africa after falling
              ill from an undisclosed ailment.

              Fatima Bulla-Musakwa THE University of Zimbabwe’s engineering
              department is witnessing the transformative impact of educational
              grants after a former lecturer, Dr Peter Ward, and his family
              committed to funding bright students from underprivileged
              backgrounds. At least 12 students from the department have been
              supported by the Ward Engineering Science Trust (WEST) scholarship
              set up by Dr Ward and his family in 2019, in honour of their late
              mother Ms Monica Fiorini. Six beneficiaries have already graduated
              with degrees in Mechanical, Civil and Electrical Engineering and
              are now employed. The other six are studying. Dr Ward said seeing
              the impact of the scholarship is gratifying. “It’s extremely
              rewarding for me to be here to see the outstanding nature of the
              students,” he said. “The fact that six of them have excellent jobs
              already is extremely gratifying and I expect that in a year’s
              time, the other six will have excellent jobs, becoming leaders
              already in the country.”
